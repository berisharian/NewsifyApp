# NewsifyApp

This web application is done by Java Spring Boot where I carry out my knowledge of in memory-based security and serves as a dynamic news platform. Enables the admin to seamlessly add, edit, and delete news articles.
Users can engage with the content through a sophisticated like button feature, allowing them to express their approval and support. Additionally, we can filter news by type or price.

To run this app download the source code in your local storage, open your IDE, then run the project. Additionaly go to browser and search 'localhost:8080'.
After these steps you will be able to see the web application successfully. 
You can login in two different ways: 
1. To login as admin:
   username: admin
   password: admin

2. To login as a user:
   username: user
   password: user
